                <h3>Where does the alphabet come from?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The origin of the alphabet is believed to have begun in ancient Egypt, when writing already had
                   more than a millennium of existence. The first known alphabet emerged around 2000 BC, and
                  it is derived from an alphabetical adaptation of Egyptian hieroglyphs. Today, almost all alphabets of the
                World descend directly from this first alphabet, or were inspired by its design.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The first purely alphabetic writing is believed to have developed around 1850 BC. C.
                    by Semitic workers established in Sinai, giving the Egyptian glyphs phonetic values of their
                    Semitic language. Over the next five centuries, this writing spread northward, and all
                    later alphabets around the world descend from it, or have been inspired by one of its
                    descendants.

                                The deed arose from the need experienced by the first societies to account for and manage their properties.

                            <p>The first writings were implemented by the inhabitants of this Mesopotamia, the Sumerians, approximately 3000 years BC. It was called cuneiform writing, because its characters were wedge-shaped.</p>
